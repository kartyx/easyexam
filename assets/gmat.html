<h1>Eligibility Criteria</h1>
Anyone and everyone is eligible for taking the GMAT (Graduate Management Admission Test). There is no minimum educational qualification requirement for taking the test. The test scores are valid for five years, i.e., most universities accept scores up to five years old. But it is always better if scores are recent (not older than 2 years).
