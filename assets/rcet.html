<h3> RESULT ANALYSIS OF CET EXAM</H3>
<br><br>
•	While the number of candidates awarded  ranks went up from 5,942 in 2010 to 13,197, engineering ranks dipped from 73,600 to 64,963, the lowest in recent years.<br><br>
•	Given there are over 81,000 engineering seats on offer in the 170-odd engineering colleges, the number of candidates who have met the eligibility requirements for engineering courses is too low.<br><br>
•	The dip in numbers is a direct fallout of the new AICTE (All-India Council for Technical Education) rules that increased the eligibility cut-off from 45 to 50 per cent for engineering courses.<br><br>
•	Some 728 candidates were allotted architecture ranks. However, 9,036 students had a tense day as they were incorrectly declared having not made it when they logged in initially. Later they were assigned ‘spot ranks'.<br><br>
•	In all, 1.07 lakh candidates appeared for CET 2013. Of those who made the cut, 13,300 are Kannada medium students.<br><br>
•	State Higher Education Minister V.S. Acharya attributed the increase in medical ranks to good performance in the Biology PU paper.<br><br>
