<h2>Quantitative Section</h2>

 <ol type='1'>
 <li> Problem solving 
 <li> Data sufficiency Problem solving and data sufficiency questions are intermingled throughout the Quantitative section.
 </ol> 
 <b>Both types of questions require basic knowledge of: </b>
 <ul>
  <li>Arithmetic 
  <li>Elementary algebra 
  <li>Commonly known concepts of geometry
</ul>
<h3>Verbal Section</h3>
 The GMAT Verbal section measures the ability to read and comprehend written material, to reason and evaluate arguments, and to correct written material to conform to standard written English. Because the Verbal section includes reading sections from several different content areas, you may be generally familiar with some of the
material; however, neither the reading passages nor the questions assume detailed knowledge of the topics discussed. Three types of multiple-choice questions are used in the Verbal section: 
<ol>
<li> Reading comprehension 
<li> Critical reasoning 
<li> Sentence correction
</ol>
<h4>Integrated Reasoning Section</h4>
 The GMAT integrated reasoning section involves some type of reasoning skills and analysis of data given to answer the question. The types of questions in IR sections are Table Analysis, Graphics Interpretation, Multi-source Reasoning and Two Part Analysis.
