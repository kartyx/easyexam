<h3>RESULT ANALYSIS OF GRE EXAM</H3>
<body>

According to the IELTS Score Analysis of the test takers based on their countries of origin, no specific trend can be seen either on the basis of the country’s location or the version of IELTS exam the candidates are taking. As is expected, in case of IELTS General Training, where candidates from UK and USA take the test, they score better. On the other hand in case of IELTS Academic, where UK and USA do not classify as one of the top places of origin, candidates from Germany score higher among the compared countries. Below is a table of the country-wise average scores of the IELTS test takers for the years 2011 and 2012 for some of the top places of origin.
