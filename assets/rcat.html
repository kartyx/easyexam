The first test of CAT 2013 is done now and so far all has been along expected lines.

The sections were available sequentially, each having a time limit of 70 minutes to answer 30 questions.
 Thus, it was mandatory to spend the stipulated time on the prescribed section and it was only when the time ended for the first section that it was possible to move to the second section. 

The total duration of the test was two hours and thirty five minutes, including a 15-minute tutorial provided to the candidates before the start of the test to familiarize them with the layout, screens and navigation.
